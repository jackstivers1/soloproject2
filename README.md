JSON persistence is storing and retrieving application data in a .json file on the server. 
In this project, the server is hosted locally via PHP, so since data is stored there and not the browser,
it can persist across refreshes and different sessions.

xampp/htdocs/api is the exact folder to place the PHP files and json file.
